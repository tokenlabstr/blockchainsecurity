# Blockchain Security Implementation

## Description

This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain with added security features to prevent transaction forgery and ensure the integrity of the chain. The code includes signing and verifying transactions using cryptographic keys, mining with proof-of-work, and validating the blockchain to detect tampering.

## Key Features:
- **Transaction Signing**: Transactions are securely signed using elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA).
- **Proof of Work**: The mining process uses a difficulty-based proof-of-work mechanism to validate new blocks.
- **Blockchain Validation**: The blockchain is validated to ensure that all transactions are valid, and no blocks have been altered.
- **Protection Against Manipulation**: Every transaction and block is verified to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-security.git
